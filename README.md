Practice codes for Machine Learning In Action by Peter Harrington

ch1.py - Numpy arrays and matrices.

ch2_knn.py - Basic KNN and visualization.

ch2_knn_dating.py - KNN for dating dataset. Look at various visualization implementations.

ch2_knn_digits.py - KNN for MNIST-like dataset. Quite sleek.

ch3_decision_tree.py - Decision Tree implemented. Took a while to grasp. Uses ID3 algorithm.

ch3_treePlotter.py - Functions to plot a decision tree.

ch3_decision_tree_lenses.py - Decision Tree for lenses dataset using ID3 algorithm.

ch4_bayes.py - Naive Bayes, using set of words, implemented. A bit different from the book. Easier to understand.
